XR.Mono.Cover (c) 2013-2018 Ian Norton
==================================

About
------

Baboon is a project about code coverage. For recording and displaying the
line-by-line coverage of CLR programs running with `mono` and and also now
displaying coverage data for C/C++ applications built by gcc with `-fcoverage`

Baboon contains three tools: `covem` and `cov-gtk` and `cov-html`

`cov-gtk` and `cov-html` are reporting tools that understand the data recorded
by `covem` and by `gcov`

`covem` is a simple code coverage tool originally for mono. It will record
which lines of your source are actually executed and log some basic statistics
like call counts and the number of times a line is actually run.

It is built on top of Mono.Debugger.Soft and so requires the mono runtime
rather than the .Net one.

Results are gathered by the covtool program and can be displayed/analysed by
the cov-console or cov-gtk programs.

Coverage data generated by covtool ( via Mono.XR.Cover library ) is saved in a
Sqlite database file for easy processing and quick generation.

covtool will run any mono/c# process you ask of it, such as nunit-console or
even graphical apps. In time covtool may allow you to attach to existing
processes after they have started.

XR.Mono.Cover will not check coverage of unmanaged code, perhaps one day if
Mono.Debugger.Soft does, this will too.

I'm only aiming at linux but this should work well on OSX and Windows ( if you
install mono ).

Like all good analysis tools, Baboon can test itself! See [here](https://raw.github.com/inorton/XR.Baboon/master/covtool/selftest.html) for some
results.

Baboon also includes a binary of nunit.framework.dll for it's tests.

Building
---------

Building baboon is fairly easy, you can use mdtool to build the solution file or load it in
monodevelop.

If you wish to make the bundled binary (not necessary but easier to deploy) do:

`$ bash make_bundle.sh`

Which should give you the 'covem' program (on linux anyway)

Installing
-----------
You can use the included Makefile to install baboon under Linux. 

Use `make install` to install without using `make_bundle.sh` (see above).
Use `make installbundle` for installing the bundled version.

Running
--------

Be sure to deploy the `libsqlite3.so.0` C library wherever you run your app. If
it is the same machine as the build was done on you neede't worry. Your 'test'
program/assembly needs to have been built with debugging enabled (you need the
mdb files) else baboon won't know how to inspect the running code.

First, we need to create a coverage config file to tell covem what
classes/types you want to record coverage data for. If you have a called called
'XR.HttpFileStream' and if your program is called '`myserver.exe`' then create
a text file called '`myserver.exe.covcfg`' and add a line to it that contains a
regex to match your type name like so:

`^XR.HttpFileStream`

Save it, and then run your program as usual but put 'covem' (or the full path
to the covem program or exe) atthe start of the line. Eg,

`$ /home/inb/tmp/covem myserver.exe --port 19000 --verbose`

And baboon will start the program and start recording coverage data.

If you are only interested in line coverage without hit counts you can add the
following line to the config file. This will increase performance
significantly.

`$HitCount=false`

The covering process may be interrupted by sending baboon _SIGINT_. The results
will still be saved.

Attaching to an existent process
=================================

baboon can be attached to an existent process as Mono Soft-Mode Debugger. Eg,

`$ /home/inb/tmp/covem -a myserver.exe 127.0.0.1 19000`

where `127.0.0.1` is the address and `19000` is the port number.

Results
========

Looking at results is fairly easy. Once your program has ended ( or after every
2 minutes, or after sending it _SIGUSR2_ ) you will find a new file called
'`myserver.exe.covdb`'. Launch the `cov-gtk` app and load this file using the
open button and you'll see coverage data as above.

`cov-html` generates an HTML summary report of coverage per class and method.
Usage: ``` covtool/bin/cov-html.exe COVDB_FILE REPORT_TITLE ``` Report is
written to `html/index.html`.

`cov-srchtml` generates HTML pages with source code coloured and annotated by
coverage status, with
a tree view for navigation. 

Usage:
```
cov-srchtml COVDB_FILE SRC_PATH OUTPUT_PATH

cov-srchtml --gcov SRC_PATH OUTPUT_PATH

```
Open `OUTPUT_PATH/index.html`.
